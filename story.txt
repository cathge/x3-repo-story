There once was a girl with really long hair. She lived in a tower far, far away. 

Sadly 'live' was only a cruel euphemism of her captors. The tower functioned as her prison--but to call it such would offend the sensibilities of even the most calloused warden. One of the few dwarves to truly fathom just how long the girl's hair really was, was the newly appointed prime minister of the eastern dwarven republic. Unwilling to allow such an incomprehensible quantity of hair to remain in enemy hands, the prime minister took immediate action.
