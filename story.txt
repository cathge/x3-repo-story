There once was a girl with really long hair. She lived in a tower far, far away. 

Sadly 'live' was only a cruel euphemism of her captors. The tower functioned as her prison--but to call it such would offend the sensibilities of even the most calloused warden. One of the few dwarves to truly fathom just how long the girl's hair really was, was the newly appointed prime minister of the eastern dwarven republic. Unwilling to allow such an incomprehensible quantity of hair to remain in enemy hands, the prime minister took immediate action.

nobody know her thought, nobody wants to know her, she just keep her secret in side her mind.

One day, as she looked out her window from the top of the tower, she heard a rustling
in the trees. The rustling was by no means small, but large. As she looked over the
treeline, she could she entire groups of trees being pushed back and forth as whatever
it was moved closer. She waited a long time for someone to come along to visit her. She
watched eagerly and intently at the rustling trees, coming closer and closer to tower.
Then, out of the treeling came a suprising sight. Her very first guests in years was some
sort of giant made out our bark being ridden by two smaller children. The two children
looked up at the girl, followed by the giant who took its time to move its head up. "No,
not this tower. I meant to other one." said one of the two children. After a coniderable
pause, the giant reponded "Oh, sorry" And slowly began walking back into the forest away
from the girl's tower.
